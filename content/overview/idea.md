It's an understatement to say that COVID-19 has transformed the landscape of academic research. The coming months will require creativity and collaboration as we retrofit office hours and workshops for screens, as we reel from the loss of funding and income. This pilot project is an effort to prepare by pooling resources and strengthening ties between local institutions. It is built on the model of mutual aid, "in which people take responsibility for caring for one another and changing political conditions . . . by actually building new social relations that are more survivable." ([Spade 2020](https://read.dukeupress.edu/social-text/article/38/1%20(142)/131/160175/Solidarity-Not-CharityMutual-Aid-for-Mobilization))

For now, our goal is to offer **digital humanities research consultations** that will **1)** provide an additional source of income to researchers in precarious roles, **2)** build a platform showcasing the broad range of forums for humanities expertise in the world, and **3)** seed research at under-resourced institutions at a moment when funding for the humanities is in jeopardy.

While the starting point for Humanist Mutual Aid is DH consultations, there are many other forms of academic mutual aid that are possible (developmental editing, book scanning, translation, etc.) We hope that the community will grow through a proliferation of these many types of exchange.
