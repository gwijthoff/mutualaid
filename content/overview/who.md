The idea for this initiative began during conversations between the Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton and the Rutgers University New Brunswick Digital Humanities Initiative. Both shops have committed to a pilot program that syncs up their consultation programs and pays researchers an hourly rate for conducting outside consultations. We are currently seeking to scale up this initiative through partnerships with additional schools in the following mid-Atlantic DH consortia: [NYCDH](https://nycdh.org/), [NJDHC](https://blogs.shu.edu/njdhc/), and [Keystone DH](http://keystonedh.network/2020/).
