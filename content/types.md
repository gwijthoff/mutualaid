title: Types of Aid
---

Survey participants will be asked to enter forms of aid and expertise that they can **provide,** that they **need,** or **both.** Eventually, forms of humanist expertise can be sampled from the data collected by the survey and featured here, e.g.

<!-- insert five examples for each sentence. Moderators can possibly generate a keyword or phrase for each textual description entered by survey participants. -->
<p class="mw6 center ba b--dashed pa3">
  Scholars in the humanities can offer [<u>idea</u>], [<u>idea</u>], and [<u>idea</u>].<br/><br/>Scholars in the humanities need [<u>idea</u>], [<u>idea</u>], and [<u>idea</u>].
</p>

In the future, community moderators might use survey suggestions to organize **scheduled events** for respondents, including: methods workshops, seminars, writing accountability groups, and consultations.

The following examples and categories of humanist mutual aid are only intended as suggestions. We welcome any and all ideas!
