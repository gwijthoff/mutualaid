The Idea
01.01.2020 00:00

COVID-19 has transformed the landscape of academic research and funding. The coming months will require creativity and collaboration. This pilot project is an effort to think about how we might pool our resources and strengthen ties between local institutions. It is built on the model of mutual aid, in which &amp;ldquo;communities take on the responsibility for caring for one another, rather than forcing individuals to fend for themselves.&amp;rdquo;
The starting point will be digital humanities research consultations. Many more forms of academic mutual aid are possible (developmental editing, book scans, etc.) and we hope the Humanist Mutual Aid community will grow through a proliferation of these many types of exchange.
For now, our goals are to use DH consultations to 1) provide researchers in precarious roles an additional source of income, 2) build a platform for those researchers to articulate and apply their expertise as humanities PhDs in a broader number of contexts, and 3) seed research at under-resourced colleges and universities at a moment when funding for the humanities will continue to shrink.
